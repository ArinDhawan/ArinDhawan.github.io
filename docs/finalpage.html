    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Despite having few cylinders, electric car brands like Tesla, Hyundai, etc., provide the </br>
        overall best average MPG. This indicates the efficiency and eco-friendliness of electric </br>
        vehicles compared to traditional gas-powered ones.The visualization's findings highlight  </br>
        the importance of considering various factors beyond the number of cylinders when evaluating  </br>
        a car's fuel efficiency.It emphasizes the potential benefits of transitioning towards electric  </br>
        vehicles to achieve better energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. </p>
